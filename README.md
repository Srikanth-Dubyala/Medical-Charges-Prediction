# Medical-Charges-Prediction
##  Project Overview
This project predicts Medical Chargesusing regression machine learning models. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.
## Dataset
- The dataset contains  features such as:
age,
sex,
bmi,
children,
smoker,
region,
charges(Target column)
##  ModelUsed
-XGBRegressor
## Results
- XGBRegressor Accuracy r2_score  =0.8628486145664009
- Used Randomsearch CV to avoid OverFitting
- OverFitting r2_score 0.9949027568474166 on training data and 0.81 on test data
